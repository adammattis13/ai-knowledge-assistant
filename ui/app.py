Upload a `.txt` file containing your reference material. Here's how it works:

1. Files should be plain text (`.txt`) format.
2. The content will be split into 500-character chunks.
3. Each chunk is embedded and stored securely in Pinecone.
4. Once uploaded, you can ask natural language questions about the content.

**Important:** Avoid uploading documents with sensitive information. This is for experimental purposes only.

st.markdown("""
Welcome to the **AI Knowledge Assistant**, a simple prototype built by [Adam Mattis](https://www.adammattis.com), a hillbilly by roots, tech exec by trade, doing his best to stay sharp in the ever-evolving world of technology.

This tool is a lightweight demonstration of how enterprise-grade AI architecture can be implemented locally and in the cloud.

### ðŸ¤– What This Is
This project is a composable, full-stack AI system that uses OpenAI for embeddings and language generation, Pinecone for high-performance vector search, FastAPI for backend services, Streamlit for a real-time user interface, and GitHub for version control.

---

### ðŸš€ How to Use It

1. **Upload a File**  
   Upload a `.txt` document containing your reference material. The system will break it into chunks and store it in a vector database.

2. **Ask a Question**  
   Enter a natural-language question based on the content of your document. The system will search for relevant context and return a GPT-4-powered response.

3. **Learn by Doing**  
   This isn't a polished product, it's an experiment. Use it to understand how generative AI systems work.
